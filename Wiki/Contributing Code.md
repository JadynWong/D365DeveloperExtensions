## Prerequisites
Visual Studio 2017  
Visual Studio 2017 SDK - [installed as an optional feature](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt683786.aspx)

If you've got existing knowledge of building extensions for Visual Studio or are willing to learn that's a bonus but I'm hoping that most of the interaction with the solution elements can be abstracted into something that's a bit easier to consume.

Basic knowledge of WPF as that's what the custom UI elements are built on in the form of user controls.
