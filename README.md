# D365 Developer Extensions - Beta
Dynamics 365 Developer Extensions for Dynamics CRM/365 Customer Engagement  
Versions 2011+  
Visual Studio 2015 & 2017

If you want to try out the beta version and provide feedback before it gets published to the Visual Studio Marketplace, download the [latest build](https://github.com/jlattimer/D365DeveloperExtensions/releases) and install. 

Wondering what changed? Check out the [Change Log](https://github.com/jlattimer/D365DeveloperExtensions/wiki/0.-Change-Log).

I recommend that if using with VS 2015, uninstall the older release of CRM Developer Extensions just in case.
