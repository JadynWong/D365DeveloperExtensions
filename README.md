# D365 Developer Extensions - Beta
Dynamics 365 Developer Extensions for Dynamics CRM/365 Customer Engagement  
Versions 2011+  
Visual Studio 2015 & 2017

If you want to try out the beta version and provide feedback before it gets published to the Visual Studio Marketplace, download the [latest build](https://github.com/jlattimer/D365DeveloperExtensions/releases) and install. 

I recommend that if using with VS 2015, uninstall the older release of CRM Developer Extensions just in case.  

Build Status: ![Build status](https://jlattimer.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/build/definitions/7c610cb1-deef-4a5b-8db0-71afc297f7f7/15/badge)

What's it's got currently:
